- It is Open source  programming language
- Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language 
- It is a Platform Independent
- It is Designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
- Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and communicating sequential processes-style concurrency.

### Advantages

- Flexible:  It is concise, simple and easy to read.
- Concurrency: It allows multiple process running simultaneously and effectively.
- Quick Outcome:  Its compilation time is very fast.
- Library:  It provide a rich standard library.
- Garbage collection:  It is a key feature of go. Go excels in giving a lot of control over memory allocation and has dramatically reduced latency in the most recent versions of the garbage collector.
- It validates for the interface and type embedding.

### Disadvantages:

- It has no support for generics, even if there are many discussions about it.
- The packages distributed with this programming language is quite useful but Go is not so object-oriented in the conventional sense.
